                    | Hi, I'm Sam, a 19-year-old
                    strong  Full-Stack Web Developer
                    | . As a developer, and even in my day-to-day life, I strive for efficiency. But, in the reality of today's online world, being fast and responsive just doesn't cut it.
                    | Being effective
                    strong  today
                    |  requires a keen balance between
                    strong  optimization
                    |  and
                    strong  aesthetics

                    | My love for programming started around late
                    strong  2011
                    | , shortly after
                    strong  Minecraft
                    |  had seen it's official release. I started tinkering with the game
                    | purely out of curiosity, and to my surprise, I really enjoyed the challenge and creative process that came along with
                    strong  Java
                    |  development. Over the years, I went onto work with some wonderful people, who would go onto become amazing friends and mentors.

                    | As time progressed, and the Minecraft community moved on, I began looking for another platform to mirror my creative desires. I had messed around with
                    | some web-based ideas before, but I had never fully immersed myself into the space - and man am I glad that I did.

                    | The switch to web was daunting at first, but as I stuck with it, my love for the space grew - and I know now that it is where I belong. Other than programming, over
                    | the years, I've come to love

                    strong  fitness
